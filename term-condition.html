                        The platform may include recommendations, viewpoints, and insights from various specialists,
                        analysts, and professionals. However, RupeeLending does not endorse or guarantee the veracity or
                        accuracy of these concepts, conclusions, findings, assertions, or data. Users must conduct their
                        own independent assessment of the appropriateness and accuracy of any goods, claims, advice,

                        on accurate and trustworthy information.</p>

                    <p>No Expert Advice<br>
                        It is crucial to understand that nothing on the site should be interpreted as offering expert
                        counsel on finance, investments, taxation, accounting, or legal matters. RupeeLending does not
                        make specific suggestions or counsel. The platform's content may be added, removed, or altered
                        at any time. RupeeLending disclaims all liability for any harm or claims resulting from these
                        modifications. Users should consult with qualified professionals in the appropriate fields to
                        address specific problems or challenges.</p>

                    <p>Absence of Measure Adoption<br>
                        Nothing on the platform should be seen as supporting a specific strategy or plan of action.
